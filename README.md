## Styling ##

Since we have known CSS and JavaScript (just understand the basic syntax), the fundamental of nowdays technology.
We use [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com) to styling our design system.
styled-components is a solid and popular css-in-js solution. It helps to elimitate the gap between CSS and JavaScript.
With styled-components, you can use CSS syntax in JavaScript via [tagged template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates).
